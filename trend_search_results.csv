Counter-attacking knocks from Rajat Patidar (52 off 32) and Will Jacks (41 off 29) coupled with an aggressive bowling and fielding performance, powered Royal Challangers Bengaluru to a 47-run win over Delhi Capitals (DC) in Match 62 of the TATA IPL 2024 at the M Chinnaswamy Stadium in Bengaluru.
Patidar revitalised RCB after the loss of Faf du Plessis and Virat Kohli inside the Powerplay and added 88 runs off 53 balls with Will Jacks to help RCB post 187/9. A collective bowling and a brilliant fielding effort then saw the home side bowl DC out for 140 and win by 47 runs.
Defending 188, RCB got off to a brilliant start, picking up four wickets inside the first four overs. Impact Player Swapnil Singh had David Warner caught at long on in the first over. Jake Fraser-McGurk, who had gotten off the mark with a six off his first ball, then took the attack to Mohd Siraj, hitting a six and a couple of fours. But DC lost two in the next over as Yash Dayal bounced out Abishek Porel off his first ball and then affected a run out at the non-striker's end to get the big wicket of Fraser-McGurk. Shai Hope hit one powerfully straight back and Dayal got a hand to it as it ricocheted onto the stumps. Fraser-McGurk was well out of his crease.

Ishant Sharma with a huge wicket. He gets rid of the big fish. Kohlu was looking solid. He was scoring runs for fun out there, but the veteran gets the better of him. It is a short ball, nipping away a touch. It takes the outside edge, goes towards the wicket-keeper and Abishek Porel makes no mistake behind the stumps. 36/2 2.2 OUT! CAUGHT! Begaluru lose their first wicket and it is their skipper. Mukesh Kumar strikes in his very first over. It is a full ball, on off. Faf du Plessis throws his bat at it. The ball flies off the splice towards deep backward point. Tristan Stubbs settles under it nicely and completes the catch. 23/1 14.4 OUT! CAUGHT! This was coming as Will Jacks was looking a bit patchy in the last few overs. Kuldeep Yadav bowls this one shorter and pushes it wide of the off stump. Jacks backs away to power it through covers but hits it a bit uppishly and flat just to the left of covers where Axar Patel takes another sharp catch. Delhi making a fine comeback here. 137/4 12.3 OUT! CAUGHT! Finally, Delhi hold on to one catch and what a stellar effort this is from Axar Patel. Rasikh Dar bangs it in a bit and keeps the line wide of the off stump, Rajat Patidar has to fetch it a bit and ends up miscuing it flat off the toe end of the bat to the right of covers. Axar attacks the ball brilliantly and leaps across to take it with both hands. A solid knock from Patidar comes to an end. 124/3 17.4 OUT! TAKEN! Abishek Porel almost made a mess of that one but eventually, he hangs on to a fine catch. Khaleel Ahmed bowls it on a hard length over off and middle stump, Mahipal Lomror looks to get under it and hoick it leg side but is late on the shot and gets a top edge that flies back over the keeper's head. Three people go after it but it is the keeper, Porel who reverse cups the swirling ball and Delhi get a crucial wicket. 174/5"

All of that for later, but locking horns tomorrow will be table-toppers KKR against GT in Ahmedabad. A must-win for GT. Meanwhile, a win for KKR will ensure a top-two finish for them. Lots at stake for both those sides as we draw curtains on the penultimate double-header of the season.

Battle of NRR: RCB will surpass CSK's run-rate if they win by 18 runs or more on May 18 (assuming they score 200 batting first). If the target is 201, they'll have to chase it down with roughly 11 balls remaining.  Cam Green | Player of the Match: Great game for our team. This year there has been so many high scores and there is little bit something there for the bowler and our bowlers were brilliant from the start. We identified that pace on is easy to play, Khaleel bowled a lot of off-cutters which were gripping and tough to target and we tried the same in our bowling. This is such a small ground and there is something in there for the bowlers which is good to see.  Faf du Plessis | RCB skipper: Brilliant, we put some good performances and really pleased. 1st half of the season, things didn't quite come together and from that batting perspective and bowling perspective we have been able to put it together now. Sometimes people talk about match-ups and all, but as a left hander with the ball spinning in, you hope that works out sometimes and he's (Swapnil) done brilliantly for us. Lot of work has gone behind the scenes, and we are getting it right and I feel there is a lot more variety in our bowling now and Yash and Lockie have been exceptional the last "
Delhi earthquake tremors,Why did Delhi's 4.0 earthquake feel stronger than it was?,https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/delhi-ncr-earthquake-40-earthquake-strong-tremors-reason-for-shaking-2681074-2025-02-17,"Listen to Story It was around 5:36 am on Monday and most of the residents in Delhi-NCR were asleep when strong tremors jolted them out of sleep and sent them running out of their houses in fear. Videos showed the ground shaking as people watched in horror. It felt like the strongest earthquake that Delhi has experienced in years.  ""I was standing in front of my dressing table when it started to shake heavily all of a sudden. At first, I thought it was due to some heavy truck passing by on the road, but then I realised it was an earthquake,"" a colleague said, adding that ""there was also this rumbling sound."" Soon after the quake, Prime Minister Narendra Modi took to social media to raise concerns and urged residents to stay alert for any aftershocks. No casualties or damage was reported, but residents were terrified due to the strong tremors. One person said, ""haven't experienced anything like this before."""
Delhi earthquake tremors,NDTV Explainer: Why Delhi Witnessed Strong Tremors Despite Low ...,https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/delhi-earthquake-today-delhi-witnessed-strong-tremors-despite-of-a-low-magnitude-quake-heres-why-7728913,"Residents of Delhi and its adjoining areas woke up to strong tremors caused by an earthquake of magnitude 4.0 this morning. According to the National Centre of Seismology, the quake hit at a depth of about 5 km. Videos showed the ground and buildings shaking, forcing people to rush out of their homes. There have been no reports of casualties or damage to properties, but many residents claimed that the tremors were so strong that it felt like a bridge was collapsing. However, the quake itself was not of a high-intensity magnitude. Generally, an earthquake below 2.5 magnitude does not cause tremors, a quake between 2.5 to 5.4 magnitude leads to minor tremors without any damage. Any quake higher than that is likely to cause strong tremors and damage. Then why did the 4.0 magnitude earthquake in Delhi feel so strong? There are many reasons behind this, mainly the epicentre of the quake was Delhi itself. According to the US Geological Survey (USGS), an earthquake's most intense shaking is often felt near the epicentre. However, the vibrations can still be felt hundreds of miles away from it. The Dhuala Kuan area - the epicentre of today's quake - has been experiencing smaller, low-magnitude earthquakes once every two to three years. It had recorded an earthquake of 3.3 magnitude in 2015. Another reason for intense tremors is that the quake was a shallow-depth earthquake. Generally, shallow earthquakes, originating five or 10 kilometres below the surface, tend to cause more damage than those originating deep below the surface. This also led to a loud grumbling sound during the quake. The USGC said that high-frequency vibrations from shallow earthquakes generate a booming sound as the ground vibrates and creates a short-period seismic wave motion that reaches the air and becomes sound waves. The shallower the epicentre, the more energy and sound can be produced."

Vivo V50,Vivo V50 review: The V40's second act - The Financial Express,https://www.financialexpress.com/life/technology-vivo-v50-review-the-v40s-second-act-3752157/,"The Financial Express  The V50, for the most part, is a repurposed V40. Vivo took the adage, “if it isn’t broke…” a little too seriously. But that is okay. Before I deep dive into making a case for this new V-series smartphone, launching today in India, let me give you my two cents on why the V50 matters. There are two reasons: (1) price and (2) ZEISS. When I say this, I am obviously presuming that Vivo will discontinue the V40 now. Otherwise, all this is moot. I have spent years covering Vivo phones. In the pre-X-series era, the V-series was the de facto “premium” Vivo banking on striking design and powerful cameras to make a selling. Their aggressive pricing made Vivo a household name long before Xiaomi entered the scene and changed the market. The arrival of the X-series and Vivo’s decision to start making “pro” V-series phones (possibly to cater to user demand), was diluting the vanilla phones—the OG V-series phones—because that is how the human mind works. I am sure Vivo sold many V40 phones, but the V40 Pro was always going to be the showstopper, one that got more attention in the news and outside of it, leaving some V40 buyers—at the very least—with the fear of missing out just because they couldn’t stretch their budget."
Vivo V50,"vivo V50 Review - Pros and cons, Verdict | 91Mobiles",https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/vivo-v50-review/,"The Vivo V-series has been catering to users seeking stylish, camera-focused smartphones. The latest addition, the Vivo V50, builds on the foundation set by the V40 (review) series, though this time, there’s no “Pro” model—at least not yet. While the V50 shares many similarities with its predecessor, it brings notable upgrades, including a larger battery, a more durable design, the latest software, and enhanced features tailored for wedding photography. Does the Vivo V50 bring enough to the table to stand out in a competitive mid-range market? Let’s find out in this review. Table of Contents The Vivo V50 stands out with its striking design, vibrant display, and feature-packed camera system optimised for wedding photography. Its enhanced durability, long-lasting battery, and refined software experience make it a strong contender in the mid-range segment. However, it faces tough competition from the OnePlus 13R (review) and Motorola Edge 50 Pro (review), which have their respective strengths in areas like camera capabilities, raw performance, and charging speeds. The Vivo V50 retains much of the design language of its predecessor, the V40, featuring a sleek form factor with curved edges and an elongated circular camera module. The key differentiator this time is the redesigned camera module, which now houses a larger Aura ring light without a dedicated auto-focus sensor. Vivo claims this enhancement improves low-light portrait photography. More on that in the dedicated camera section."
Vivo V50,vivo V50 review - The Indian Express,https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-reviews/vivo-v50-review-9840331/,"We normally don’t associate good cameras with mid-range smartphones. In fact, even some high-end smartphones fail to impress us when it comes to photography. Vivo is one of the few smartphone brands that has been challenging this notion, and with its latest vivo V50, the company might have taken mid-range camera-centric smartphones to a whole new level. I have been testing the vivo V50 for over 10 days, and here is my comprehensive review of this camera champ: The Starry Night variant of the vivo V50, which I have been testing, appeared typical when viewed from a distance during a product briefing. However, when I held it in my hand, I could truly appreciate its beauty. This is the first smartphone in India to feature 3D-Star technology. This adds depth to the device, making it look surreal and unlike anything I have seen on the back of a smartphone. While this isn’t the thinnest or lightest device in its category, it has a certain heft that offers a premium in-hand feel. The curved display and panel back also enhance the overall ergonomics. While the V50 is available in more subtle colour options like Titanium Grey, I believe Starry Night is the variant to get, as it can double as a conversation starter. The vivo V50 is IP68/IP69-rated and comes with an underwater camera mode. This is one of those phones that can accompany you in the shower or during a swim session in a pool."

Prakriti Lamsal, a third-year B.Tech student from Butwal, reportedly took her own life on Sunday after enduring persistent harassment from an Indian student. Fellow Nepali students claimed that despite previous complaints, the university administration failed to take action against the perpetrator. Following Lamsal’s death, Nepali students staged a peaceful protest demanding justice. However, instead of addressing their concerns, the university administration ordered them to vacate the hostels. “We were demanding justice for Prakriti in a peaceful manner, but instead of listening to us, they forced us out,” the Kantipur daily reported a protesting Nepali student said. “Those who refused to leave were beaten by security guards.” The university took more than 500 Nepali to the railway stations in Bhubaneswar and Cuttack for expulsion, but with the next train to Nepal only available on Thursday, many remain stranded. KIIT, the police have launched an investigation, and the student accused of harassing the victim girl has been arrested. "

Prakriti Lamsal, a third-year B Tech student, was found dead in her hostel room on Sunday evening.  The protesting students, including Nepali nationals, accused the university authorities of high-handedness and cover-up and alleged that Nepali students had been arbitrarily directed to vacate the campus. They are demanding transparency in the investigation. Nepal Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli has taken note of the situation and stated that the country's embassy in New Delhi has sent two officers to counsel Nepali students affected in Odisha. He added that arrangements have been made to allow the students to either stay in their hostel or return home. Prakriti's friends alleged that harassment by her ex-boyfriend, identified as Advik Srivastava, drove her to take the extreme step. Her brother also filed a police complaint, citing the alleged harassment. He is in police custody and has been charged with abetment of suicide under Section 108 of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS)."

Narendra Modi (born September 17, 1950, Vadnagar, India) is an Indian politician and government official who rose to become a senior leader of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). In 2014 he led his party to victory in elections to the Lok Sabha (lower chamber of the Indian parliament), after which he was sworn in as prime minister of India. Prior to that he had served (2001–14) as chief minister (head of government) of Gujarat state in western India. The Modi-led BJP (and the BJP-led NDA alliance) won the majority again in the 2019 general election. Although the BJP failed to secure a majority on its own in the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, the BJP-led NDA alliance won 293 of the 543 seats in the Lok Sabha, paving the way for Modi to become the country’s prime minister for a third consecutive term. Modi was raised in a small town in northern Gujarat, and he completed an M.A. degree in political science from Gujarat University in Ahmedabad. He joined the pro-Hindutva Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) organization in the early 1970s and set up a unit of the RSS’s students’ wing, the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad, in his area. Modi rose steadily in the RSS hierarchy, and his association with the organization significantly benefited his subsequent political career. Modi joined the BJP in 1987, and a year later he was made the general secretary of the Gujarat branch of the party. He was instrumental in greatly strengthening the party’s presence in the state in succeeding years. In 1990 Modi was one of the BJP members who participated in a coalition government in the state, and he helped the BJP achieve success in the 1995 state legislative assembly elections that in March allowed the party to form the first-ever BJP-controlled government in India. The BJP’s control of the state government was relatively short-lived, however, ending in September 1996. In 1995 Modi was made the secret"

 Shri Narendra Modi was sworn-in as India’s Prime Minister for the third time on 9th June 2024, following another decisive victory in the 2024 Parliamentary elections. This victory marked the third consecutive term for Shri Modi, further solidifying his leadership. The 2024 elections saw a remarkable voter turnout, with a significant portion of the electorate showing continued confidence in Shri Modi’s leadership and vision for the country. His campaign focused on a blend of economic development, national security, and social welfare programs, which resonated widely with the populace. Shri Modi’s third term is expected to build on the foundations laid during his previous tenures, with a renewed emphasis on technological innovation, infrastructure development, and international diplomacy, further positioning India as a global powerhouse. The unprecedented third term underscores Shri Modi’s enduring appeal and the trust placed in him by millions of Indians to lead the nation towards greater prosperity and stability. The first ever Prime Minister to be born after Independence, Shri Modi has previously served as the Prime Minister of India from 2014 to 2019, and from 2019 to 2024.

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi once famously made a simple election promise: “good days are coming.”
     
            To his adoring supporters, it’s a vision of a future now finally within reach should Modi and his right-wing Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) secure an emphatic and rare third consecutive term at this month’s nationwide election.
     
            At his rallies, tens of thousands gather in near frenzied religious devotion in support of a man whose policies they say have transformed the lives of ordinary Indians – and helped enshrine the nascent promise of social mobility in a country still riven by caste divisions.
     
            Modi projects himself as an outsider from humble origins. Born as the son of a tea seller in a small town in Gujarat, he does not fit neatly within the often privately educated, resolutely metropolitan, English-speaking template set by many previous Indian leaders.
     
            The 73-year-old is single, has no children, and seemingly shuns expensive material possessions in favor of a simple, ascetic lifestyle.

On the occasion of the Tamil star’s 40th birthday on Monday, renowned filmmaker AR Murugadoss unveiled a special teaser of their upcoming film, sparking great excitement among fans thanks to its impressive visuals and scale. Titled Madharasi, the 44-second teaser highlights that the film will seamlessly blend all commercial elements and even more, while also ensuring the signature Murugadoss experience, all with Sivakarthikeyan at its centre. Even as the title glimpse video opens with a series of aerial and long shots, showcasing a car godown and a line of container trucks moving in succession, it soon cuts to a massive crash in which a truck, seemingly intentionally, rams into a group of cars, sending them flying. The teaser then quickly introduces Sivakarthikeyan’s character, revealing that he’s not a random nobody but someone to be feared, as he gears up to take on a group of armed men single-handedly. Amid big explosions and high-octane action sequences, we are also introduced to the characters played by Rukmini Vasanth, Vidyut Jammwal and Biju Menon, all integral pieces in this sprawling, high-stakes narrative. Set against the outline map of South India, appears the title Madharasi, a term used both as a demonym and a regional slur for people from the region. Written and directed by Murugadoss, the film’s music is composed by Anirudh. The makers also released the second look of Madharasi, featuring five different reactions of Sivakarthikeyan. Incidentally, it is speculated that Sivakarthikeyan plays a character with a distinct behavioural trait, and it would be interesting if this five-reaction image is a reflection of that idea. The celebration isn't over yet ❤️‍🔥"

 Madharasi (transl. People of Madras)[a] is an upcoming Indian Tamil-language action thriller film written and directed by A. R. Murugadoss. It is produced by N. Srilakshmi Prasad under Sri Lakshmi Movies. The film stars Sivakarthikeyan and Rukmini Vasanth in the lead roles, alongside Vidyut Jammwal, Biju Menon, Vikranth, Shabeer Kallarakkal, Prem Kumar, Sanjay and Sachana Namidass.
 The film was officially announced in September 2023 under the tentative titles SKxARM and SK23, as it is Sivakarthikeyan and Murugadoss's first collaboration and the former's 23rd film as a lead actor, and the official title was announced in February 2025. Principal photography commenced in February 2024. It was shot in locations including Chennai and Pondicherry. The film has music composed by Anirudh Ravichander, cinematography handled by Sudeep Elamon and editing by A. Sreekar Prasad.
 Madharasi is scheduled to be released in 2025 in theaters.
 In March 2020, director AR Murugadoss, who had previously collaborated with Vijay for three films—Thuppakki (2012), Kaththi (2014) and Sarkar (2018)—was reported to join hands with the latter for the fourth time.[4][5] Kalanithi Maran's Sun Pictures was reported to fund the project, which was tentatively titled Thalapathy 65,[6] and Thaman S was reportedly approached to score the music, in what would have been his maiden collaboration with Vijay and Murugadoss.[7][8] On 24 August, Murugadoss confirmed the reunion with the actor, and dismissed the rumours of the film being a sequel to one of their previous projects.[9][10] However, in that October, Murugadoss was ousted by the production company citing his refusal to reduce his salary due to the failure of his previous film, Darbar (2020).[11][12] The company, in that December, had announced that Nelson Dilipkumar had replaced Murugadoss for Thalapathy 65,[13][14] which eventually became Beast (2022).[15][16]

GBS,Guillain-Barré syndrome - Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guillain–Barré_syndrome,"
 Guillain–Barré syndrome (also called ""GBS"") is a rapid-onset muscle weakness caused by the immune system damaging the peripheral nervous system.[3] Typically, both sides of the body are involved, and the initial symptoms are changes in sensation or pain often in the back along with muscle weakness, beginning in the feet and hands, often spreading to the arms and upper body.[3] The symptoms may develop over hours to a few weeks.[3] During the acute phase, the disorder can be life-threatening, with about 15% of people developing weakness of the breathing muscles requiring mechanical ventilation.[1] Some are affected by changes in the function of the autonomic nervous system, which can lead to dangerous abnormalities in heart rate and blood pressure.[3]
 Although the cause is unknown, the underlying mechanism involves an autoimmune disorder in which the body's immune system mistakenly attacks the peripheral nerves and damages their myelin insulation.[3] Sometimes this immune dysfunction is triggered by an infection or, less commonly, by surgery, and by vaccination.[1][3] The diagnosis is usually based on the signs and symptoms through the exclusion of alternative causes and supported by tests such as nerve conduction studies and examination of the cerebrospinal fluid.[3] There are several subtypes based on the areas of weakness, results of nerve conduction studies, and the presence of certain antibodies.[5] It is classified as an acute polyneuropathy.[1]
 In those with severe weakness, prompt treatment with intravenous immunoglobulins or plasmapheresis, together with supportive care, will lead to good recovery in the majority of cases.[3] Recovery may take weeks to years, with about a third having some permanent weakness.[3] Globally, death occurs in approximately 7.5% of those affected.[1] Guillain–Barré syndrome is rare, at 1 or 2 cases per 100,000 people every year.[3][4] The illness that afflicted US president Franklin D. Roosevelt, and left him paralysed from th"

It is a rare condition, and while it is more common in adults and in males, people of all ages can be affected. Symptoms typically last a few weeks, with most individuals recovering without long-term, severe neurological complications. The first symptoms of Guillain-Barré syndrome include weakness or tingling sensations. They usually start in the legs and can spread to the arms and face.

Available in Puma Grey of the Piranha Red colorways, priced at $6599 MSRP and scheduled to arrive in dealers by April of 2025, the Tuono is very similar to the RS 457 in that it runs the same twin-spar aluminum chassis (the only one in its class), and the same parallel-twin motor that pumps out a claimed 48 hp at 9400 rpm and 32 lb-ft of torque at 6200 rpm. The Tuono 457 gets a ride-by-wire throttle and three riding modes in Eco, Rain and Sport, ABS and traction control (not Cornering ABS/TC as there’s no six-axis IMU), and a five-inch TFT dash. The suspension is the same as the RS 457 in the 41mm inverted fork and rear monoshock, both preload adjustable. Braking comes in the form of the ByBre four-piston front caliper gripping a 320mm disc and Bosch two-channel ABS system with dual-mapping, available either on both wheels or only on the front. Aprilia claims a dry weight 350 lb, before you add the 3.4 gallon of go juice. The Tuono 457 enters the market against bikes like the Yamaha MT-03, Kawasaki’s recently revamped Ninja 500, and the KTM 390 Duke. There’s also a massive line of accessories developed by Aprilia for the Tuono 457, including a single-seat cover, different footpegs, brake and clutch levers, a quickshifter, USB port, tire pressure monitor, comfort seat, anti-theft alarm, and different race-spec brake pads. Aprilia has also teamed with Alpinestars to create a full line of Tuono 457 accessory clothing."

But unlike the bigger Tuonos, that have nearly the same amount of plastic as the RSV4s, the Tuono 457 does not have its fairings integrated into the frame. It really does have a more minimal set of fairings attached to the sides. With that, let’s explore the Tuono 457 a little more. "

New Delhi railway station,New Delhi railway station - Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Delhi_railway_station,"
 New Delhi railway station (station code: NDLS[1]) is the primary railway hub for the Indian capital, New Delhi, and an integral part of Indian Railways. Situated in Central Delhi, approximately 2 kilometers north of Connaught Place, the station features 16 platforms with entrances at Paharganj (platform 1) and Ajmeri Gate (platform 16). It is among the busiest railway stations in India, handling a high frequency of trains and substantial passenger traffic on a daily basis.
 Until the 1950s, the Old Delhi railway station served as the principal railway station in Delhi. The New Delhi railway station was officially inaugurated in 1956, boasting of a single platform. The station building at Paharganj was the first in India to provide common facilities for all passenger classes, including a unified entry and exit. By the 1970s, as the station reached capacity, ongoing efforts have been made to decongest both the station and rail traffic.
 By the 1980s, the station had expanded to seven platforms, which increased to ten by 1995, and eventually to sixteen during the redevelopment in 2010. The redevelopment also included upgrading the new station building facing Ajmeri Gate. Additionally, the station was integrated with the Delhi Metro network through the New Delhi metro station.
 The 16 platforms at New Delhi railway station accommodate over 250 trains that start, terminate, or pass through the station daily. Estimates of the daily footfall and the number of passengers handled vary depending on the study and the time of year. On average, the station experiences a daily footfall of approximately 500,000 passengers, a figure that can rise to 600,000 during peak festival seasons.

But on Saturday night, a deadly crush - reportedly caused by overcrowding - killed at least 18 people and left several injured. According to officials, two trains had been delayed at the station, while a third - heading to Prayagraj city where the massive Hindu religious festival, Kumbh Mela, is being held - was waiting to depart as people pushed against each other. The crush occurred after ""a passenger slipped and fell on the stairs"", a spokesperson for Indian Railways said. Opposition leaders have criticised the government, alleging that Indian Railways did not make adequate arrangements to manage crowds at the station."

The stampede broke out around 10 pm as thousands of Maha Kumbh devotees bound for Prayagraj packed platforms 14 and 15 of New Delhi Railway Station, sparking panic among travelers. An incorrect platform change announcement may have triggered the stampede at, sources said, citing poor crowd management as a key factor. Initial findings suggest the chaos began after an announcement about special trains, prompting a rush onto platforms and causing several passengers to fall. Poor infrastructure, insufficient staff, inadequate safety measures, and abrupt platform changes all contributed to the disorder, making movement difficult.

Fire,Incidents | CAL FIRE,https://www.fire.ca.gov/incidents,"Ongoing emergency responses in California, including all 10+ acre wildfires. Structures Destroyed
   December, 2024- Following recent rainfall that has moderated fire activity, CAL FIRE is transitioning to Winter Preparedness staffing levels statewide. This adjustment aligns with a seasonal decrease in fire activity and aims to strategically optimize resources as fire risks lessen during the cooler months.

Although California experienced a higher-than-usual number of fires this year, total acreage burned remains slightly below the five-year average but exceeds last year's figures. Forecasts indicate that above-normal temperatures and below-normal precipitation will persist through February, sustaining elevated fire risk, particularly in Southern California. An increased frequency of offshore wind events may also heighten fire concerns in specific areas. Over the next several months, an active Jet Stream is expected to bring cool, moist conditions, encouraging the growth of lowland vegetation and snow in higher elevations. These conditions, combined with a shift toward greener fuels, are expected to lower the potential for significant fires over the next 2-3 months. Southern California remains the exception, where some heightened fire risk may persist.

Despite these seasonal shifts, CAL FIRE remains vigilant and prepared to respond to any challenges posed by the ongoing elevated fire risk.

The resources that CAL FIRE staffs year-round will spend these months engaged in fuel reduction projects and other fire prevention efforts as weather permits."
Fire,Fire - Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire,"
 Fire is the rapid oxidation of a material (the fuel) in the exothermic chemical process of combustion, releasing heat, light, and various reaction products.[1][a]
Flames, the most visible portion of the fire, are produced in the combustion reaction when the fuel reaches its ignition point. Flames consist primarily of carbon dioxide, water vapor, oxygen and nitrogen. If hot enough, the gases may become ionized to produce plasma.[2] The color and intensity of the flame depend on the type of fuel and composition of the air.[3]
 Fire, in its most common form, has the potential to result in conflagration, which can lead to permanent physical damage. It impacts ecological systems worldwide. Fire's positive effects of include stimulating plant growth and maintaining ecological balance. Its negative effects include hazard to life and property, atmospheric pollution, and water contamination.[4] When fire removes protective vegetation, heavy rainfall can cause soil erosion.[5] Additionally, the burning of vegetation releases nitrogen into the atmosphere, unlike other plant nutrients such as potassium and phosphorus which remain in the ash and are quickly recycled into the soil.[6][7] This loss of nitrogen produces a long-term reduction in the fertility of the soil, though it can be recovered by nitrogen-fixing plants such as clover, peas, and beans, by decomposition of animal waste and corpses, and by natural phenomena such as lightning.
 Fire is one of the four classical elements and has been used by humans in rituals, in agriculture for clearing land, for cooking, generating heat and light, for signaling, propulsion purposes, smelting, forging, incineration of waste, cremation, and as a weapon or mode of destruction.
 The word fire comes from Old English fȳr and has cognates in many Germanic languages and other Indo-European languages.[8] The Proto-Germanic nominative form is reconstructed as *fōr, descending from Proto-Indo-European *péh2wr.[8] An alternative spelling ex"

Fire is a rapid burning of combustible material in the presence of oxygen manifested as flames. It is usually accompanied by heat and light. Fire is one of humanity’s essential tools, control of which helped start humans on the path toward civilization. Evidence suggests that the earliest controlled use of fire by hominins was about 1,420,000 years ago. However, it was not until about 7000 BCE that Neolithic humans acquired reliable fire-making techniques, in the form either of drills, saws, and other friction-producing implements or of flint struck against pyrites. Early humans used fire to keep warm and cook their food. They also learned to use it in hunting and warfare, to kill insects, and to clear forests of underbrush so that game could be better seen and hunted. The most widespread method of producing fire among prehistoric peoples was the friction method. Most commonly, a pointed hardwood was twirled between the palms and pressed into a hole on the edge of a softer wood. Flint, pyrites, and fire drills have been found in Neolithic sites in Europe."

Fire,Fires - How They Start and How They Spread - FireArrest,https://firearrest.com/fires-how-they-start-and-how-they-spread/,"Fires are one of the most powerful natural forces that humanity has learned to harness, yet they remain a formidable threat to life, property, and the environment. Understanding the dynamics of how fires start, spread, and can be controlled is not just a matter of curiosity but a crucial aspect of ensuring safety and minimising damage. This knowledge is vital for everyone from homeowners to business operators, from students to professionals in the fire safety industry. It empowers individuals and communities to take proactive measures in fire prevention, management, and response. The purpose of this article is to demystify the science behind fires. By dissecting the mechanisms of how fires ignite and propagate, we aim to provide a comprehensive guide that enlightens and equips readers with the information necessary to understand fire behaviour and adopt effective strategies to prevent and combat fires. At the heart of understanding how fires start is the concept of the fire triangle. A fire needs three elements to ignite and sustain itself: heat, fuel, and oxygen. Removing any one of these components will extinguish the fire. Heat: Heat is the energy source that initiates the fire. It raises the temperature of the fuel to its ignition point. Sources of heat can be anything from a small spark to a larger flame or even environmental heat in the case of spontaneous combustion. Fuel: Fuel is any combustible material. It can be solid, such as wood or paper; liquid, like petrol or alcohol; or gas, such as propane. The fuel acts as the sustenance for the fire, allowing it to grow and spread."

Fire,"Fire - Simple English Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia",https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire,"Fire is a chemical reaction that gives off light and heat. Fire happens when a material rapidly oxidizes, or loses electrons, and releases a great amount of energy. Flames are only the portion of the fire that gives off visible light. 
 Fire is sometimes useful, but also very dangerous because it can cause houses, trees and other things to burn to ashes. Forest fires are very harmful. They can destroy a huge area in a matter of minutes. Every year people die by accidents from fire.
 Fire can be started by heating a material in many different ways. Once the material is heated past a temperature called the ignition point, it will start to burn, beginning a fire. Some common ways to start a fire include rubbing sticks together very rapidly, making sparks by hitting flint with steel, or using matches or a lighter. The Sun does not make fire. Instead, it crushes together hydrogen atoms to release energy through a process called nuclear fusion.
 Fire can be very useful if it is treated carefully. It has always been very important for people to be able to make fire. People need its heat to keep warm on cold days. It is also used to cook meats. Its light helped people see in dark places and scare away predators.
 Most heat engines work by fire.

Mitchell Santner: Glenn's brilliant knock and his partnership with Bracewell gave us the much-needed momentum. We were looking at something around 280-300 at one point. The Pakistani bowlers bowled really well and it needed a special knock from Glenn to take us to 330. There was a bit of assistance for the spinners and that was nice. The big wicket of Fakhar helped us to keep chipping away in the middle overs. It looked tough in the powerplay. I guess it's never easy when Babar and Fakhar are batting together. We were able to put in the squeeze in the middle overs. The conditions in Karachi are a little different and we know how good Pakistan are. (On Bracewell's catch) He has got very big hands and he made it look simple.  Mohammad Rizwan: When we lose, it looks difficult only. When we were bowling, the wicket looked a bit difficult. The way Phillips batted was outstanding. When we focus on what we improve on, we need to work on our fielding. If we play an all-rounder, we can't expect him to bowl ten overs, he can give us 5-6 overs. (On Haris Rauf's injury) There's no confirmation yet but it's not a serious injury. As a batting unit, we need to analyse the situation and bat. We need to stitch good partnerships when wickets are falling.  Glenn Phillips | Player of the Match: We had a tough little middle period, Pakistani bowlers bowled well. The way Bracewell came in and kicked on was great and I tried to continue the momentum and followed his lead. I love my bowling. That was pretty special, obviously my first hundred and that felt great. We talk about giving our best and to me be able to add as much energy as I can to the team matters.  22:11 Local Time, 17:11 GMT, 22:41 IST: A clinical display from the Kiwis to register a comprehensive win in th"

Valentine's Day,Valentine's Day - Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valentine's_Day,"
 Valentine's Day, also called Saint Valentine's Day or the Feast of Saint Valentine,[1] is celebrated annually on February 14.[2] It originated as a Christian feast day honoring a martyr named Valentine, and through later folk traditions it has also become a significant cultural, religious and commercial celebration of romance and love in many regions of the world.[3][4]
 There are a number of martyrdom stories associated with various Saint Valentines connected to February 14,[5] including an account of the imprisonment of Saint Valentine of Rome for ministering to Christians persecuted under the Roman Empire in the third century.[6][7] According to an early tradition, Saint Valentine restored sight to the blind daughter of his jailer.[8] Numerous later additions to the legend have better related it to the theme of love: tradition maintains that Saint Valentine performed weddings for Christian soldiers who were forbidden to marry by the Roman emperor;[7] an 18th-century embellishment to the legend claims he wrote the jailer's daughter a letter signed ""Your Valentine"" as a farewell before his execution.[9]
 The 8th-century Gelasian Sacramentary recorded the celebration of the Feast of Saint Valentine on February 14.[10][11] The day became associated with romantic love in the 14th and 15th centuries, when notions of courtly love flourished, apparently by association with the ""lovebirds"" of early spring. In 18th-century England, it grew into an occasion for couples to express their love for each other by presenting flowers, offering confectionery, and sending greeting cards (known as ""valentines""). Valentine's Day symbols that are used today include the heart-shaped outline, doves, and the figure of the winged Cupid. In the 19th century, handmade cards gave way to mass-produced greetings.[12] In Italy, Saint Valentine's keys are given to lovers ""as a romantic symbol and an invitation to unlock the giver's heart"", as well as to children to ward off epilepsy (called Sai"

 Love is an emotion that has captivated human fascination since the dawn of time. It is the focus of poetry, art, music, and literature. It has ignited wars, inspired revolutions, and given rise to countless stories. While many holidays center around historical events, cultural traditions, or religious significance, Valentine's Day is the only holiday dedicated to celebrating love—the most fundamental and universal human emotion. But what makes love so compelling? How did Valentine's Day come to be, and what does it truly signify? More importantly, why should we celebrate it not only with our romantic partners but also with family and friends? Let’s explore the origins, significance, and broader implications of this cherished holiday. Love, in its many forms, is as old as human existence. Anthropologists believe that the evolutionary basis of love lies in the need for survival. Love fosters connections between parents and children, ensuring the survival of their offspring. Romantic love developed to strengthen pair bonds, facilitating cooperation among individuals in a world where working together increases the chances of survival."

Here are the facts you may not know—plus, fun ideas for Valentine's Day 2025.  Whether you love Valentine's Day or hate it, one thing is clear: The holiday goes way back. And while it's now known for kissing, Valentine's Day gifts, and hard-to-get dinner reservations, the origins of the holiday are far less romantic. Here, the Valentine's Day history that wouldn't make it into a rom-com, including a martyred saint and a massacre.
  First, a quick refresher: Valentine's Day always falls on February 14, but the day of the week varies by year. In 2025, Valentine's Day will be on a Friday for the first time since 2020.
  Some historians believe it has roots in the ancient Roman festival of Lupercalia. Held yearly on February 15, Lupercalia celebrated the coming of spring and fertility. It involved animal sacrifice, lots of drunken revelry, and possibly a ritual in which men and women were paired off by choosing names from a jar.
  As Christianity spread, pagan rituals fell out of favor. At the end of the 5th century AD, Pope Gelasius I outlawed the celebration. He's sometimes credited with implementing St. Valentine's Day, a holy feast day, to replace it, but we don't have definitive proof of that. Regardless, the Christian holiday eventually overtook the riotous Lupercalia.
