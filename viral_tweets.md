2/ VAR controversy strikes again! Rayo’s Pathe Ciss penalized for pulling down Martínez in the box–leading to Lewandowski’s 20th goal of the season. Was the contact enough to warrant a penalty? Fans are split, but Barça capitalized when it mattered. 🔥🚨  

3/ Rayo thought they had leveled the score in the dying minutes of the first half, but *surprise surprise*—disallowed for offside. Frustrated fans are already calling out La Liga refereeing again. Is officiating getting worse, or is it just more scrutinized? 🤔 #LaLiga

5/ With 14 games to go, La Liga is heating up! Barça lead on goal difference, but will it be enough? Real Madrid are lurking, and every game will now feel like a final. 😤🔥

## Grok 3 news
**One-liner Tweet:** "Elon Musk’s Grok 3 claims to be the 'smartest AI' on the planet. With 100,000 Nvidia GPUs backing it, this is more than just a tech flex – it’s a power move to dominate the AI race. ⚙️ Will it outsmart GPT-4 or is it just hype? Time will tell. #AIRevolution #Grok3 #TechWar"

### Twitter Thread:
### Twitter Thread: **“Grok 3 is here. The AI wars just levelled up.”**

1/ **Elon Musk’s Grok 3 is LIVE tonight.** They’re calling it “the smartest AI on Earth.” A bold claim, but if true, it’s a declaration of WAR in the AI race. Here’s why Grok 3 could change everything 👇 #AI #TechNews 🚀

2/ Powered by **100,000 NVIDIA H100 GPUs** and developed on xAI’s Colossus supercomputer, *Grok 3* isn’t just another chatbot. It’s trained for precision, creativity, AND problem-solving. No hype—actual SYSTEMATIC upgrades like reduced hallucination rates. **Game. Changer.**

3/ Musk is NOT here to participate. He’s here to DOMINATE. Grok 3 has explicitly been pitched against OpenAI’s GPT-4. A direct challenge to the throne of ChatGPT. The billion-dollar question: Can xAI’s underdog punch above its weight? #AIcompetition

4/ What makes it different?  
✅ *Enhanced Reasoning Capabilities*  
✅ Synthetic datasets for accuracy  
✅ ADMITS & self-corrects errors with reinforcement learning  
✅ Reportedly “more insightful” than existing systems  

Kya ChatGPT ka asli challenger finally aa gaya? 🤔

5/ This isn’t just innovation. It’s a **geopolitical flex.**  
As the US and China aggressively compete in AI, Grok 3 is Musk’s message: “Western AI dominance is far from over.” Remember, DeepSeek’s Chinese AI also claimed breakthroughs recently. Now, the real comparisons begin. 🌍⚡  

6/ But let’s also step back—Musk is hyping it, as always. Is Grok 3 actually “next-level”? The live demo at 8 pm PT will tell. *Real-world users* will determine if this tech walks its talk. Are we watching history, or just good branding?  

LOTS riding on this one. Stay tuned. 🔥 

7/ Final thoughts:  
The AI era isn’t coming—it’s HERE. Grok 3’s evolution proves one thing: The pace of innovation is faster than most governments can handle. Strap in, doston, the next decade will literally rewrite reality. #AIRevolution  

What do you think—will Grok 3 dethrone GPT-4? Or is this just another billion-dollar gamble? 👇 Let’s discuss. Twice as sharp takes welcome! #xAI

## Earthquake in Delhi news
**One-liner Tweet:** Delhi just experienced one of its strongest tremors in years—4.0 magnitude at Dhaula Kuan. No casualties, thankfully, but a reminder: Nature's fury spares no one. Stay alert, stay prepared. 🌍🇮🇳 #DelhiEarthquake #Earthquake

### Twitter Thread:
### Thread: EARTHQUAKE IN DELHI 🚨

1/ ⚠️ **Tremors in Delhi-NCR!**  
A 4.0 magnitude earthquake shook Delhi, Noida, Gurugram, and Ghaziabad early this morning (5:36 am). Epicentre? Right in **south Delhi's Dhaula Kuan** – shallow depth of 5KM gave it a strong impact. No casualties reported so far 🙏, but let's unpack this. 🔽  

2/ The timing couldn’t be more telling: A city already stressed with pollution, population pressure, and unchecked urbanisation is now literally **shaking!** Nature is warning us. Why is no one asking tough questions about disaster readiness in our political and media discourse?  

3/ **Where’s the infrastructure for emergencies in the capital?**  
Buildings shook, emergency services gave helpline numbers, and people stepped into panic mode. But do we have evacuation drills? Structural audits? Or is it all jugaad as usual? 🤔  

4/ Tremors are a reminder: Delhi-NCR sits on a **seismic zone IV (4)** → prone to major earthquakes. Yet, **illegal construction mafia** thrives, and unchecked urbanisation is normalized in the name of ‘development.’ Where are the accountability mechanisms in place? 😡  

5/ And let’s be real – if this wasn’t a moderate 4.0 but a 7.0+ magnitude quake, could we handle it? Are Delhiites even prepared mentally or logistically for a major natural disaster? This should worry **every policymaker** & every family in the NCR. 🙏  

6/ Prime Minister @narendramodi’s quick reaction reflects leadership – urging precaution and calm 🌟. But the larger focus has to be building **resilient cities** for the future!  
Earthquakes can’t be stopped, but casualties CAN be minimised if we act wisely.  

7/ To my fellow Delhi-NCR citizens: Nature’s repeated warnings are no joke, yaar. 🌏 Whether it's this earthquake or the floods last monsoon, preparedness matters.  
✅ Build safer homes.  
✅ Learn evacuation protocols.  
✅ Demand accountability from local urban planners!  

8/ India has survived every challenge before – we’re **#Atmanirbhar** for a reason 💪. Let’s prepare better as a nation for BOTH man-made & natural disasters. Delhi’s future depends on BALANCE: Protecting heritage 🏛️ AND securing its foundations for future generations. 🇮🇳  

9/ If you felt the tremors today, or have disaster-prep tips, share in the replies. Let’s spread awareness & ensure we’re better prepared next time.  

Until then, #StaySafeDelhi 🌏🙏  
Jai Hind 🇮🇳

### Twitter Thread:
🚨 **WPL 2025 Update: RCB Crushes Delhi!** 🚨  
Thread on how **Royal Challengers Bengaluru** 🇮🇳 is rewriting history and why Smriti Mandhana is officially the Queen of the WPL. 👑🔥  

1/ **Reigning Champions, Unstoppable Force** 🌟  
RCB continues its unbeaten run with an **8-wicket victory** over Delhi Capitals.  
Bowling? 🔥 Fielding? 💯 Smriti’s Batting? Next Level. 💥  
RCB looks like THE team to beat this season! #WPL2025 #RCBvsDC  

2/ **Bowling Masterclass! 🎯**  
RCB bowled out DC for 141 in just 19.3 overs.  
- Renuka Singh: 3/23 (unplayable!) 😳  
- Georgia Wareham: 3/25 (lethal lines 🚀).  
RCB is proving that T20 isn’t just about big hitters—it’s about **precision bowling** too! 👏  

3/ **Smriti Mandhana = LEGEND.** 🔥  
81 off 47. Pure class, zero compromises.  
With Danni Wyatt-Hodge (42 off 33), she stitched a 107-run opening stand! 🏏  
When Smriti’s in form, it’s less cricket and more poetry in motion. 🇮🇳  
#SmritiMandhana #RCB  

4/ **Delhi Capitals' Jinx Continues?**  
Last season, RCB took the finals.  
This time? Another loss for DC, courtesy RCB supremacy! 🤷  
**Too many talented players**, but no consistency under pressure. Smriti’s leadership >>> theirs. #DelhiCapitals  

5/ **It’s Bigger than the Game.**  
RCB winning isn't just a sporting moment—it’s a reminder of Indian women's cricket's sheer dominance. 💪

## Delhi earthquake news
**One-liner Tweet:** "Delhi wakes up to tremors, not just of the earth but a reminder: Are we truly prepared for disasters of this scale? No casualties today, but is our infrastructure resilient enough for tomorrow? #DelhiEarthquake #StaySafe"

### Twitter Thread:
🚨 **Thread: Delhi Earthquake – A Wake-Up Call for NCR?** 🚨

1/ Early morning jitters in #Delhi as a 4.0 magnitude earthquake hits NCR. Epicenter? Dhaula Kuan, the heart of the capital! Tremors shook homes, woke people from sleep & sent many rushing outdoors. Thankfully, no casualties, but is this the wake-up call we need? 🙏 #DelhiEarthquake  

2/ Delhi NCR sits on **Zone-IV**, one of India’s high-risk seismic zones. Lakhs live in congested colonies & poorly planned buildings. The real threat isn’t just earthquakes – it’s our carelessness. Are we ready for the “Big One”? 🤔  

3/ **Fun Fact, or perhaps a warning?** Japan faces magnitudes FAR higher than 4.0 regularly, yet its infrastructure holds up. Why? Strict building codes & preparedness. Meanwhile, in Delhi-NCR, does anyone even check if building norms are followed? Accountability = zero.  

4/ Props to PM Modi for urging calm & caution. But here’s the bigger picture: We need to go beyond Twitter advisories. Mock drills, emergency infrastructure, strict building audits – are these just "urban planners’ dreams," or will action finally meet words?  

5/ By the way, Delhi Police deserves credit for pushing the helpline (112). But let’s spare a moment to think—how many of us actually *know* what to do during an earthquake? For most, it’s panic → run → chaos. Survival needs training, not luck. 🏚️ 🚨  

6/ Time to ask tough questions:  
- Are NCR’s buildings compliant with seismic safety standards?  
- Where is the disaster management plan?  
- Is our emergency response system robust? Or are we, as always, relying on jugaad? 💭  

7/ Every tremor is not just a geographical event; it’s a **reminder**. A reminder to be prepared, to demand better resilience from our systems, and to rethink urban planning. Let’s not wait for a tragedy to act. 🙏  

8/ Delhiites, don’t rely on “bhagwan ke bharose.” Prepare for aftershocks:  
- Stay away from weak walls & heavy objects.  
- Have a kit ready—torches, food, power banks.  
- Know evacuation routes.  

**Jaan hai toh jahaan hai.**  

Stay safe, India! Jai Hind. 🇮🇳 #EarthquakeSafety #DisasterPreparedness

## News Today news
**One-liner Tweet:** "While the West juggles resignations, Taiwan tensions, and Putin summits, India's focus remains on self-reliance and sovereignty. Global distractions won’t derail Bharat’s resurgence. 💪🇮🇳 #AtmanirbharBharat #Geopolitics"

### Twitter Thread:
🚨🧵 | News Today Highlights – What should India take away? 🇮🇳

1️⃣ **Leadership resignations & scrutiny in the West:** Michelle King’s exit may just be the beginning. With rising regulatory cracks in the system, are we about to witness the decline of "global leaders"? 

Meanwhile, India’s political, economic, & regulatory ecosystem has stayed resilient. No resignations, no mass controversies! 🙌 Who’s the *real* stable power now? 👉 #NewIndia  

---

2️⃣ **U.S.-China drama over Taiwan:** America flip-flops its Taiwan policy, sparking anger in Beijing. The *real question* is—why this doublespeak?  

China weaponizes diplomacy, the U.S. backpedals. Yet, when **India** speaks on sovereignty—be it #Kashmir or #Arunachal—it’s *clear*, *consistent*, & *unwavering*. जय हिंद! 💪🇮🇳

---

3️⃣ **Trump-Putin summit buzz in Riyadh:** Superpowers chasing "peace talks” amid rising tensions. Let’s not forget who has consistently advocated for global peace: **India**! 🕊️

## KIIT news
**One-liner Tweet:** A young Nepali student loses her life, protests erupt, and tough questions arise on KIIT's accountability. If prior complaints were ignored, who takes responsibility? Justice for Prakriti is non-negotiable. Institutions must prioritize student safety over PR optics. #JusticeForPrakriti

### Twitter Thread:
**Thread:** A young life lost at #KIIT, raising questions about safety on campuses and the failure to act despite warnings. Here’s what you need to know 🧵👇:

1/ Tragedy struck #KIIT as Prakriti Lamsal, a 3rd-year Nepali student, allegedly died by suicide due to harassment and blackmail by a male classmate. The accused has been arrested, but why did it take a death for action to be taken? 💔

2/ Reports allege that despite prior complaints to the university's International Relations Office, no concrete steps were taken. This is NEGLIGENCE of the worst kind. Institutions exist to *protect* students, not brush their grievances under the rug. #JusticeForPrakriti

3/ Protests erupted on campus, with Nepali students & ABVP members demanding accountability. And rightly so. Students trusted KIIT not just with their education but *their lives*—trust that was mercilessly broken. Where are the officials who failed to act? 🤔

4/ KIIT statements blame "personal issues" between the deceased & the accused. Classic deflection tactic! Even IF personal, why not intervene during early complaints? Why does “responsibility” begin only after a tragedy? These hollow justifications won't suffice. 🚨

5/ Safety of international students is non-negotiable. Their welfare reflects on India’s image worldwide. To our Nepali brothers & sisters—this fight for #JusticeForPrakriti isn’t just yours, it’s *ours*. India must stand by you. 🙏

6/ This isn’t just about KIIT, or one institution—this is about systemic apathy across campuses nationwide. Abetment by harassment, blackmail, neglect—it’s a LOOPHOLE our educational & legal systems must address. *Now.*

7/ The protests shouldn’t just end with a statement or increased security measures. We need policy overhauls & accountability frameworks in every campus across Bharat. Students' concerns must be acted on BEFORE they reach a breaking point.

8/ To the university: **Stop prioritizing reputation over resolution.** Grievance redressal mechanisms must work transparently, or they’re as good as nonexistent. Prakriti’s death is a wake-up call. Don’t let it go unheard. 🌷

9/ No family should lose their child because of insensitivity and indifference. To all students raising their voice for Prakriti, your fight matters. Let’s keep it alive until accountability is delivered. #JusticeForPrakriti

We will be watching. 📢💔

And guess what? It’s ALREADY in profit, as the budget was ₹130 Cr. No overhyped PR, just pure storytelling and patriotism winning hearts. 🙌 #BollywoodWins  

5/ A film about *Chhatrapati Sambhaji Maharaj*—India’s forgotten warrior—has captivated millions. Why? Because we’re DONE with shallow remakes and agenda-driven scripts. The audience CRAVES stories of our heroes. Finally, Bollywood is listening. 🙏🇮🇳 #ChhaavaRevolution  

6/ Vicky Kaushal shines as a warrior king who stood tall against Aurangzeb’s tyranny! Rashmika Mandanna brings grace and fire, proving why she’s the heartthrob of pan-India cinema. This is a film we DESERVE! 👑 #ChhaavaMagic

✅ Respect the audience's intelligence.  

Masses don’t reject Bollywood—they reject mediocrity. *Chhaava* is proof. ✊🔥  

8/ Where are the so-called intellectuals now? Those who claimed *period dramas* don’t work without agendas? Sambhaji Maharaj’s heroic life is a testament to India’s unshakeable spirit. NATION-FIRST stories will NEVER fail. #ChhaavaTheAnswer
