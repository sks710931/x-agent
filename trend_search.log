2025-02-18 00:15:15,806 - INFO - Extracted Text: Residents of Delhi and its adjoining areas woke up to strong tremors caused by an earthquake of magnitude 4.0 this morning. According to the National Centre of Seismology, the quake hit at a depth of about 5 km. Videos showed the ground and buildings shaking, forcing people to rush out of their homes. There have been no reports of casualties or damage to properties, but many residents claimed that the tremors were so strong that it felt like a bridge was collapsing. However, the quake itself was not of a high-intensity magnitude. Generally, an earthquake below 2.5 magnitude does not cause tremors, a quake between 2.5 to 5.4 magnitude leads to minor tremors without any damage. Any quake higher than that is likely to cause strong tremors and damage. Then why did the 4.0 magnitude earthquake in Delhi feel so strong? There are many reasons behind this, mainly the epicentre of the quake was Delhi itself. According to the US Geological Survey (USGS), an earthquake's most intense shaking is o...

The latest addition, the Vivo V50, builds on the foundation set by the V40 (review) series, though this time, there’s no “Pro” model—at least not yet. While the V50 shares many similarities with its predecessor, it brings notable upgrades, including a larger battery, a more durable design, the latest software, and enhanced features tailored for wedding photography. Does the Vivo V50 bring enough to the table to stand out in a competitive mid-range market? Let’s find out in this review. Table of Contents The Vivo V50 stands out with its striking design, vibrant display, and feature-packed camera system optimised for wedding photography. Its enhanced durability, long-lasting battery, and refined software experience make it a strong contender in the mid-range segment.

2025-02-18 00:15:23,342 - INFO - Extracted Text: The Financial Express  The V50, for the most part, is a repurposed V40. Vivo took the adage, “if it isn’t broke…” a little too seriously. But that is okay. Before I deep dive into making a case for this new V-series smartphone, launching today in India, let me give you my two cents on why the V50 matters. There are two reasons: (1) price and (2) ZEISS. When I say this, I am obviously presuming that Vivo will discontinue the V40 now. Otherwise, all this is moot. I have spent years covering Vivo phones. In the pre-X-series era, the V-series was the de facto “premium” Vivo banking on striking design and powerful cameras to make a selling. Their aggressive pricing made Vivo a household name long before Xiaomi entered the scene and changed the market. The arrival of the X-series and Vivo’s decision to start making “pro” V-series phones (possibly to cater to user demand), was diluting the vanilla phones—the OG V-series phones—because that is how the human mind works. I am sure Vivo sold many...

Situated in Central Delhi, approximately 2 kilometers north of Connaught Place, the station features 16 platforms with entrances at Paharganj (platform 1) and Ajmeri Gate (platform 16). It is among the busiest railway stations in India, handling a high frequency of trains and substantial passenger traffic on a daily basis.
 Until the 1950s, the Old Delhi railway station served as the principal railway station in Delhi. The New Delhi railway station was officially inaugurated in 1956, boasting of a single platform. The station building at Paharganj was the first in India to provide common facilities for all passenger classes, including a unified entry and exit. By the 1970s, as the station reached capacity, ongoing efforts have been made to decongest both the station and rail traffic.
 By the 1980s, the station had expanded to seven p...

"Had this been announced properly, making passengers understand that Prayagraj Express and Prayagraj Special are two different trains and that they should board only their respective booked trains, there are greater chances that the chaos would not have occurred," KP Arya, a former chief signal and telecom engineer, information technology in the Northern Railway, said. "I am not saying that there were no other reasons that led to the tragedy, but prima facie, it looked like people got mixed up due to the announcement of trains with almost similar names," he added. Arya emphasised the need to use the manual-announcement feature, which is also available in the Automatic Announcement System depending on the situation, and s...

   December, 2024- Following recent rainfall that has moderated fire activity, CAL FIRE is transitioning to Winter Preparedness staffing levels statewide. This adjustment aligns with a seasonal decrease in fire activity and aims to strategically optimize resources as fire risks lessen during the cooler months.

Although California experienced a higher-than-usual number of fires this year, total acreage burned remains slightly below the five-year average but exceeds last year's figures. Forecasts indicate that above-normal temperatures and below-normal precipitation will persist through February, sustaining elevated fire risk, particularly in Southern California. An increased frequency of offshore wind events may also heighten fire concerns in specific areas. Over the next several months, an active Jet Stream is expected to bring cool, moist conditions, encouraging the growth of lowland veg...

 Fire is the rapid oxidation of a material (the fuel) in the exothermic chemical process of combustion, releasing heat, light, and various reaction products.[1][a]
Flames, the most visible portion of the fire, are produced in the combustion reaction when the fuel reaches its ignition point. Flames consist primarily of carbon dioxide, water vapor, oxygen and nitrogen. If hot enough, the gases may become ionized to produce plasma.[2] The color and intensity of the flame depend on the type of fuel and composition of the air.[3]
 Fire, in its most common form, has the potential to result in conflagration, which can lead to permanent physical damage. It impacts ecological systems worldwide. Fire's positive effects of include stimulating plant growth and maintaining ecological balance. Its negative effects include hazard to life and property, atmospheric pollution, and water contamination.[4] When fire removes protective vegetation, heavy rainfall can cause soil erosion.[5] Additionally, th...

Fire is a rapid burning of combustible material in the presence of oxygen manifested as flames. It is usually accompanied by heat and light. Fire is one of humanity’s essential tools, control of which helped start humans on the path toward civilization. Evidence suggests that the earliest controlled use of fire by hominins was about 1,420,000 years ago. However, it was not until about 7000 BCE that Neolithic humans acquired reliable fire-making techniques, in the form either of drills, saws, and other friction-producing implements or of flint struck against pyrites. Early humans used fire to keep warm and cook their food. They also learned to use it in hunting and warfare, to kill insects, and to clear forests of underbrush so that game could be better seen and hunted. The most widespread method of producing fire among prehistoric peoples was the friction method. Most commonly, a pointed hardwood...

 There are a number of martyrdom stories associated with various Saint Valentines connected to February 14,[5] including an account of the imprisonment of Saint Valentine of Rome for ministering to Christians persecuted under the Roman Empire in the third century.[6][7] According to an early tradition, Saint Valentine restored sight to the blind daughter of his jailer.[8] Numerous later additions to the legend have better related it to the theme of love: tradition maintains that Saint Valentine performed weddings for Christian soldiers who were forbidden to marry by the Roman emperor;[7] an 18th-century embellishment ...

Valentine’s Day is a holiday when lovers express their affection with greetings and gifts. It is also called St. Valentine’s Day. The holiday has expanded to express affection between relatives and friends. Valentine’s Day is celebrated annually on February 14. Although there were several Christian martyrs named Valentine, Valentine’s Day may have taken its name from a priest who was martyred about 270 CE by the Roman emperor Claudius II Gothicus. Other accounts hold that it was St. Valentine of Terni, a bishop, for whom the holiday was named, though it is possible that the two saints were actually one person. Valentine’s Day is popular in the United States as well as in Britain, Canada, and Australia, and it is also celebrated in other countries, including Argentina, France, Mexico, and South Korea. In the Philippines, it is the most common wedding anniversary. ...

There have been no reports of casualties or damage to properties, but many residents claimed that the tremors were so strong that it felt like a bridge was collapsing. However, the quake itself was not of a high-intensity magnitude. Generally, an earthquake below 2.5 magnitude does not cause tremors, a quake between 2.5 to 5.4 magnitude leads to minor tremors without any damage. Any quake higher than that is likely to cause strong tremors and damage. Then why did the 4.0 magnitude earthquake in Delhi feel so strong? There are many reasons behind this, mainly the epicentre of the quake was Delhi itself. According to the US Geological Survey (USGS), an earthquake's most intense shaking is o...

The
quake prompted Prime Minister Narendra Modi to issue a message, urging people to stay calm and be alert for âpossible aftershocks. On X, he wrote that âauthorities were keeping a close watch on the situation.â This isnât the first time that the capital has been shaken after it experienced tremors. Earlier on January 23, Delhi-NCR experienced strong tremors after a
7.2-magnitude earthquake hit Xinjiang in China, at a depth of 80 kilometres. This came after the capital experienced mild tremors on January 11, when a a 6.1-magnitude earthquake struck Afghanistan. But whatâs behind Delhi experiencing so many tremors? And just how bad was the quake this time around? We have the answers....

2025-02-18 00:22:30,255 - INFO - Extracted Text: The Financial Express  The V50, for the most part, is a repurposed V40. Vivo took the adage, “if it isn’t broke…” a little too seriously. But that is okay. Before I deep dive into making a case for this new V-series smartphone, launching today in India, let me give you my two cents on why the V50 matters. There are two reasons: (1) price and (2) ZEISS. When I say this, I am obviously presuming that Vivo will discontinue the V40 now. Otherwise, all this is moot. I have spent years covering Vivo phones. In the pre-X-series era, the V-series was the de facto “premium” Vivo banking on striking design and powerful cameras to make a selling. Their aggressive pricing made Vivo a household name long before Xiaomi entered the scene and changed the market. The arrival of the X-series and Vivo’s decision to start making “pro” V-series phones (possibly to cater to user demand), was diluting the vanilla phones—the OG V-series phones—because that is how the human mind works. I am sure Vivo sold many...

2025-02-18 00:22:30,471 - INFO - Extracted Text: The Vivo V-series has been catering to users seeking stylish, camera-focused smartphones. The latest addition, the Vivo V50, builds on the foundation set by the V40 (review) series, though this time, there’s no “Pro” model—at least not yet. While the V50 shares many similarities with its predecessor, it brings notable upgrades, including a larger battery, a more durable design, the latest software, and enhanced features tailored for wedding photography. Does the Vivo V50 bring enough to the table to stand out in a competitive mid-range market? Let’s find out in this review. Table of Contents The Vivo V50 stands out with its striking design, vibrant display, and feature-packed camera system optimised for wedding photography. Its enhanced durability, long-lasting battery, and refined software experience make it a strong contender in the mid-range segment. However, it faces tough competition from the OnePlus 13R (review) and Motorola Edge 50 Pro (review), which have their respective stren...

2025-02-18 00:22:30,794 - INFO - Extracted Text: We normally don’t associate good cameras with mid-range smartphones. In fact, even some high-end smartphones fail to impress us when it comes to photography. Vivo is one of the few smartphone brands that has been challenging this notion, and with its latest vivo V50, the company might have taken mid-range camera-centric smartphones to a whole new level. I have been testing the vivo V50 for over 10 days, and here is my comprehensive review of this camera champ: The Starry Night variant of the vivo V50, which I have been testing, appeared typical when viewed from a distance during a product briefing. However, when I held it in my hand, I could truly appreciate its beauty. This is the first smartphone in India to feature 3D-Star technology. This adds depth to the device, making it look surreal and unlike anything I have seen on the back of a smartphone. While this isn’t the thinnest or lightest device in its category, it has a certain heft that offers a premium in-hand feel. The curved di...

2025-02-18 00:24:05,220 - INFO - Extracted Text: As expected, Aprilia has unveiled the naked version of its excellent RS 457 sportbike to create the Tuono 457, thus making a perfect family of high performance nakeds and their sportbike brothers in the RSV4/Tuono 1100, and RS 660/Tuono 660. Available in Puma Grey of the Piranha Red colorways, priced at $6599 MSRP and scheduled to arrive in dealers by April of 2025, the Tuono is very similar to the RS 457 in that it runs the same twin-spar aluminum chassis (the only one in its class), and the same parallel-twin motor that pumps out a claimed 48 hp at 9400 rpm and 32 lb-ft of torque at 6200 rpm. The Tuono 457 gets a ride-by-wire throttle and three riding modes in Eco, Rain and Sport, ABS and traction control (not Cornering ABS/TC as there’s no six-axis IMU), and a five-inch TFT dash. The suspension is the same as the RS 457 in the 41mm inverted fork and rear monoshock, both preload adjustable. Braking comes in the form of the ByBre four-piston front caliper gripping a 320mm disc and Bos...

The naked version of the RS457 sportbike, the Tuono 457 follows the recipe of a naked bike born from a sportbike by replacing fairings for handlebars. But unlike the bigger Tuonos, that have nearly the same amount of plastic as the RSV4s, the Tuono 457 does not have its fairings integrated into the frame. It really does have a more minimal set of fairings attached to the sides. With that, let’s explore the Tuono 457 a little more. ...

Hot on the heels of jumping into the entry-level sportbike class with the 2024 Aprilia RS 457, the Italian firm has announced its newest member of the revered Tuono family, and it is aimed at new or returning riders. Meet the 2025 Aprilia Tuono 457.

"Had this been announced properly, making passengers understand that Prayagraj Express and Prayagraj Special are two different trains and that they should board only their respective booked trains, there are greater chances that the chaos would not have occurred," KP Arya, a former chief signal and telecom engineer, information technology in the Northern Railway, said. "I am not saying that there were no other reasons that led to the tragedy, but prima facie, it looked like people got mixed up due to the announcement of trains with almost similar names," he added. Arya emphasised the need to use the manual-announcement feature, which is also available in the Automatic Announcement System depending on the situation, and s...

   December, 2024- Following recent rainfall that has moderated fire activity, CAL FIRE is transitioning to Winter Preparedness staffing levels statewide. This adjustment aligns with a seasonal decrease in fire activity and aims to strategically optimize resources as fire risks lessen during the cooler months.

Although California experienced a higher-than-usual number of fires this year, total acreage burned remains slightly below the five-year average but exceeds last year's figures. Forecasts indicate that above-normal temperatures and below-normal precipitation will persist through February, sustaining elevated fire risk, particularly in Southern California. An increased frequency of offshore wind events may also heighten fire concerns in specific areas. Over the next several months, an active Jet Stream is expected to bring cool, moist conditions, encouraging the growth of lowland veg...

 Fire is the rapid oxidation of a material (the fuel) in the exothermic chemical process of combustion, releasing heat, light, and various reaction products.[1][a]
Flames, the most visible portion of the fire, are produced in the combustion reaction when the fuel reaches its ignition point. Flames consist primarily of carbon dioxide, water vapor, oxygen and nitrogen. If hot enough, the gases may become ionized to produce plasma.[2] The color and intensity of the flame depend on the type of fuel and composition of the air.[3]
 Fire, in its most common form, has the potential to result in conflagration, which can lead to permanent physical damage. It impacts ecological systems worldwide. Fire's positive effects of include stimulating plant growth and maintaining ecological balance. Its negative effects include hazard to life and property, atmospheric pollution, and water contamination.[4] When fire removes protective vegetation, heavy rainfall can cause soil erosion.[5] Additionally, th...

Fire is a rapid burning of combustible material in the presence of oxygen manifested as flames. It is usually accompanied by heat and light. Fire is one of humanity’s essential tools, control of which helped start humans on the path toward civilization. Evidence suggests that the earliest controlled use of fire by hominins was about 1,420,000 years ago. However, it was not until about 7000 BCE that Neolithic humans acquired reliable fire-making techniques, in the form either of drills, saws, and other friction-producing implements or of flint struck against pyrites. Early humans used fire to keep warm and cook their food. They also learned to use it in hunting and warfare, to kill insects, and to clear forests of underbrush so that game could be better seen and hunted. The most widespread method of producing fire among prehistoric peoples was the friction method. Most commonly, a pointed hardwood...

 Fire is sometimes useful, but also very dangerous because it can cause houses, trees and other things to burn to ashes. Forest fires are very harmful. They can destroy a huge area in a matter of minutes. Every year people die by accidents from fire.
 Fire can be started by heating a material in many different ways. Once the material is heated past a temperature called the ignition point, it will start to burn, beginning a fire. Some common ways to start a fire include rubbing sticks together very rapidly, making sparks by hitting flint with steel, or using matches or a lighter. The Sun does not make fire. Instead, it crushes together hydrogen atoms to release energy through a process called nuclear fusion.

However, New Zealand have edged ahead again with a missed DRS and a dropped catch from Pakistan helping their cause.

However, Salman Ali Agha gave Pakistan an opening by dismissing Williamson on 34, thus ending a 71-run stand between him and Conway. Pakistan were all out for just 242 runs.
